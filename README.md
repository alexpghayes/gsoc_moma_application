GSOC Modern Multivariate Analysis
---------------------------------

So far I have:

-   Implemented the L1 penalized rank 1 SFPCA algorithm in R
-   Implemented the L1 penalized rank 1 SFPCA algorithm in C++ using Armadillo
-   Wrapped the C++ implementation with `Rcpp`
-   Tested both implementations with `testthat`
-   Passed `R CMD check` with no warnings or errors

**This application is in progress and is not yet complete**
