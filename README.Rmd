## GSOC Modern Multivariate Analysis 

So far I have:

  - Implemented the L1 penalized rank 1 SFPCA algorithm in R
  - Implemented the L1 penalized rank 1 SFPCA algorithm in C++ using Armadillo
  - Wrapped the C++ with `Rcpp`
  - Created tests for the implementation with `testthat`
  - Passed `R CMD check` with no warnings or errors

Unfortunately my results don't match up with Dr. Allen's MATLAB at the moment, so there's still some debugging to do.

**This application is in progress and is not yet complete**
