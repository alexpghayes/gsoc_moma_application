# GSOC Modern Multivariate Analysis

**This application is in progress and is not yet complete**

So far I have:

  - Implemented the L1 penalized rank 1 SFPCA algorithm in R
  - Implemented the L1 penalized rank 1 SFPCA algorithm in C++ using Armadillo
  
Next steps:

  - Legitimate tests based on the provided MATLAB code

At this point both the R and C++ code runs and I get the same values when on the `iris` dataset:

```{r}
library(moma)

X <- as.matrix(iris[, 1:4])
sfpca(X, 10, 4)  
sfpca_r(X, 10, 4)
```

The results match up with a standard rank 1 SVD when no penalties are included.

```{r}
irlba::irlba(X, 1, 1)
sfpca(X)
```
