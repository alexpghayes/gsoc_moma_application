## GSOC Modern Multivariate Analysis 

So far I have:

  - Implemented the L1 penalized rank 1 SFPCA algorithm in R
  - Implemented the L1 penalized rank 1 SFPCA algorithm in C++ using Armadillo
  - Wrapped the C++ implementation with `Rcpp`
  - Tested both implementations with `testthat`
  - Passed `R CMD check` with no warnings or errors

**This application is in progress and is not yet complete**
